/**
 *A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone.
 * The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water. Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in
 * sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially,
 * the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit. If the frog's last jump was k units, then
 * its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
